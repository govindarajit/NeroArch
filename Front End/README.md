# Introduction

  * Frontend is a react native application so that we can run it on ios and android.
  * We have created two separate applications - one for driver and one for the customer.
  * We assume that the driver and customer has accounts on the blockchain so that they can exchange ether.
  * In case the ether balance is low for the customer, the customer needs to add the balance to his/her account before
  they can ride the cab.

# Introduction

This is a blockchain application on Ethereum whose functionality is similar to Uber, hence we call it Eber :P <br/>
The Backend is a smart contract written in solidity. Middleware is a java application acting as a server for the Front End.
This Middleware connects to the blockchain and communicates with the smart contract deployed on the blockchain.
The Front End is a react-native application that contacts the Middleware through REST API.
